# New WCIP Issue

ATTENTION! If you would like to submit a WCIP and it has already been written as a draft (see the [template](https://github.com/ethereum/WCIPs/blob/master/wcip-X.md) for an example), please submit it as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ethereum/WCIPs/pulls).

If you are considering a proposal but would like to get some feedback on the idea before submitting a draft, then continue opening an Issue as a thread for discussion. Note that the more clearly and completely you state your idea the higher the quality of the feedback you are likely to receive.
